# Frontend deployment guide
## Deploying on Vercel
Since we are using Next.js to build the frontend, we can easily deploy it to production using Vercel platform. Follow the steps below to deploy your dApp on Vercel.

### Create a Vercel account
Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) and create an account. Choose `Continue with GitHub` to link your GitHub account with the platform,
and go through with the sign up process.

### Import your `inkathon` repository
Once you are successfully signed up, import your `inkathon` repository on Vercel. You can do so on this [link](https://vercel.com/import/git).
First, install `Vercel for GitHub`. Then, either give access to `All repositories` or `Only select repositories` and select your `inkathon` repository to import it.

### Configure your ink!athon deployment
A `Configure Project` form will appear.

You can leave the form as is -- it will use **pre-defined values** and Vercel will automatically detect that it is a Next.js app
and will set up optimal build settings for you. 

However, make sure that the `Root directory` field is empty (set to the root of monorepo), otherwise the build might fail.

Click on `Deploy` to continue.

Your Next.js app will start building. It will finish in a couple of minutes. When the deployment is done, you will get **deployment URLs**. Click on one of them to visit your app live.

Congratulations! Your dApp is now live on Vercel and publicly accessible.
